Music is a big part of my life. I've been in a few bands through out my history, check that info out below.  My tastes are varied and since I've started using Google Play Music to listen to and sync music across devices, I don't really have something to share for my tastes.  You could check out my last.fm page, but it is probably out of date by quite a number of years.  I've started to add [Music Blog Posts](../categories/music)

Anyways, on to the bands I've been in....

# deanboswell
This was the first band I was in; it was when I was in college. Some of us in the band wanted a name that was a bit edgy and "punkish" in nature. A few of us liked "Postal Workers", and there was another suggestion I'm not putting up (this is a family website). We ended up with deanboswell because the Dean of Student Affairs at JHU was Mrs. Boswell.

I don't think any of us knew how to play before starting, so please be kind if listening to our stuff. That is not totally true though, Eugene had played before, and brought a lot of skill to the band. The line-up was Matt - vocals, Eugene - guitar, Marc - guitar, Brendan - drums, Rio - bass. Time period is around 1993/4. We all poured our hearts into learning, playing and mostly having a great time hanging out with each other. I still get chills listening to these songs around 15 years later. Anyways, without further ado, feel free to download our first and only album:

I'm very fond of these songs and we all were sad (I think) when we graduated and went our separate ways. Well, sorta on the separate ways part... read on...

# One Night With Meredith

This band was just after college. The lead guitar player from deanboswell, Eugene, and I started it and found two guys from D.C. to fill out the drums (Steve) and vocals (Adam). We ended when Steve (the drummer) graduated, Eugene had to finish up Med School and I moved to Boston. We have some recordings but they need work. So that winds up making them low priority. :-(

# Hump

This was a band I was in after I moved up to Boston. It was a great experience to get my feet wet playing again. It had been so long. We tried for a while, but some thought it wasn't working out. I'm not sure if anything we had recorded is worth putting up. I have to find what is worth it and go through the cleanup. So again, low priority. :-(

# The Snakes

This is another band, more recent, from Boston. How we formed was somewhat interesting, less so how we broke up. We started when Andy Jag, John Vranich and I were talking about playing music at our weekly frisbee game. So we started to find covers and began to play. Then John said he knew a drummer, Julie. Later on, she wanted to play guitar, but happened to work with a guy, Sean, who played guitar, but wanted to play drums. Shortly, and sadly later, most of us wanted to write originals, and John didn't have the desire or time to devote to that, so he left. Around the same time a sometimes frisbee-goer, Alex, kinda fell into playing with us. So that was the final line-up: Andy - singer, Alex - guitar/vocals, Julie - guitar/vocals, Sean - drums and Rio - bass. Time period was around 2005/6.

Near the end (typical saying as bands go) we tried a semi-professional recording setup in one of our houses. I think the songs were great, they had a quality of differing melodies that fit together. Something I personally love and was mentioned at one of our gigs. Either way, I hope everyone from The Snakes are proud of these songs. We never finished them, but here you can download the rough mixes Andy did:

In the end, like I said, we never finished them nor really got out to play a whole lot. Julie wanted to concentrate more on her own music; Andy and Alex wanted a break; and the rhythm section always seems to roll with it. Well, I don't think Sean nor I were happy, but life goes that way sometimes. Anyways, I know Alex is still playing and putting out music.
