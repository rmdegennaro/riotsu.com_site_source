[Thoughtful Blog Posts](../categories/thoughtful) are me working through ideas.  It might be scary, but you can get an idea of how I work through ideas.  These are mostly "philosophical" in approach.  Some have "accused" them of intellectualization.  :-) I call them thoughtful because, to me, they are more simply full of thoughts.  

Other things that are more "permanent" in their idea as well as their expression are below.

It then gathers value slowly, dependent on how many people can sing along." - paraphrased from John Perry Barlow

## My Own Thoughts:

  * the two trues sins are laziness and fear.
  * to change the world one has to take their undue share of what they're trying to change.
  * the world around us causes our internal pendulums to swing. when it swings to extremes, we are unsettled. when it does not swing we are   * listless. we can never, should never, stop the pendulum from swinging. yet since most of the world around us cause it to swing to extremes, we should find ways to lessen the arch.
  * all our problems stem from when we deny the similarities and differences in reality around us. we need to notice the real patterns which is implicit in understanding when things are alike and when they are different.
