I've been really busy, so haven't had time to keep track of the little I did well.  This is basically chronicling my experiment of using <a href = "http://www.android-x86.org/" target="blank">Android-x86</a> on a laptop that used to run Windows XP.  Here is a recap of a couple of days combined.

### 8/5/2014

  * Checked email, easy to do when brain-dead from a long day.
  * Played Andor's Trail a little bit.
  * Noticed the cut and paste semantics feel a bit odd, but that's because keyboard shortcuts are not available.  Instead I'm using long mouse presses like long touchs on a touchscreen.

### 8/6/2014

  * All I did was check email again, not a good test so far...

### 8/7/2014

  * Disc this day, so didn't even check email, just adding this entry later...

#### 8/8/2014

  * Not really an update on usage, but at work we have Samsung SF310's.  They are newer machines, and run Windows 7 (and Ubuntu) quite well.  But they also run Android-x86 just as well.  Also, Wi-Fi and sound work them out of the box (see below).
  * Had to work late at home on coding project, so had to use desktop.  Adding this entry later...
  * I did find out the drivers for sound that came built into Android-x86 do not work.  I wanted to play music from Google Play Music while I worked, but did it from desktop...
  * Still, I marked the playlists I wanted for offline playing.  Will have to check for drivers and if the offline download worked just like on my phone.
