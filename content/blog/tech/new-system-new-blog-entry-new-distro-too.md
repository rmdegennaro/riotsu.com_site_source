I recently had the opportunity to get an Dell XPS M1530 really cheap.  So we have the home laptop and now I have a laptop to play around with.  Yah!

My intention is to blog what I do with the XPS laptop.  As I have time to play with it, I'll add new blog entries.  Changing jobs and home life causing changes in focus is okay too.  Right now I've loaded Linux Mint Debian Edition, with the Cinnamon desktop.  I'm doing this entry from it.  I'm sure this system will be very useful in my tech adventures.
