Hello again, back at my distro hopping.  Well, not really, the main machines (desktop and laptop) are still <a href = "http://www.kubuntu.org/" target="blank">Kubuntu</a>.  But if there were a distro to switch to, it might be <a href = "https://antergos.com/" target="blank">antergos</a> Linux.  At least at first "blush".  Wow, easy install, easy setup, easy updates.  And it feels snappy...

More details to come.  For now, the machine is a Toshiba Satellite A105-S4254:  Intel Dual Core T2050 / 1.6 GHz, 3GB RAM, 7200RPM SATA hard drive.  And with using the Mate desktop, this old machine is fast.  In some ways it feels snappier then CloudReady.

I'll try to type up more of my exploration of <a href = "https://antergos.com/" target="blank">antergos</a> Linux soon, but not tonight.
