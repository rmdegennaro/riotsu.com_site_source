I have an old Toshiba 32-Bit laptop that had Windows XP on it.  And since <a href = "http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-support-hel" target="blank">Windows XP</a> is no longer supported, I decided to put <a href = "http://www.android-x86.org/" target="blank">Android-x86</a> on it.  I did this a while back, but haven't had the chance to play with it much.  My plan now is to use it as my main laptop and keep a log of what I do or can't do on it for the next bit....

Things I did tonight:

  * Check schedule to hang out with friend.  Though we didn't find a date good for both of us, this was simple.
  * Emails via GMail app was easy to check, reply and manage.
  * Start this as a Google document, which was create it via Google Drive app in folder I liked.  I noticed it was marked "Offline" automatically.  I could do all regular formatting that I wanted.  I easily used Google Chrome browser to get both http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-support-help and http://www.android-x86.org and swap back to this document to paste them.  But I could not select text and make it a link.  Minor for most cases.  Maybe I'll check the blogger site, Google Sites or something else for it.
  * Surf a bit, check some online "magazine" type sites.
  * The Google+ app blows up, but the website version works fine in Google Chrome.  
  * Surf a bit more.  It was nice to go from Google+ to a shared article and then links from there...
  * Installed Family Guy game.  Works fine on my phone, but unfortunately it blew up on this laptop.  
  * Installed F-Droid.org and then installed Andor's Trail.  Played a bit.  
  * Updated this document and now going to shutdown since the battery is already really poor.

A side note added to this on 8/9/2014 is that though I can't add links in Google Docs, I can in the webclient for blogger.com.  So I've added the two links I wanted to add. For webclient of blogger.com, PRO = adding links, CON = no offline edits.
