Linux "distros" are many.  Linux is awesome that way: <a href = "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scratch_an_itch" target="blank">scratch an itch</a>, <a href = "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mountain_to_climb" target="blank">climb that mountain</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_killed_the_cat" target="blank">being as satisfied as a cat</a>.  I encourage folks to explore.  Head over to <a href = "https://distrowatch.com/" target="blank">Distro Watch</a> to start exploring.

But what makes one stick to a distro?  Its a very personal thing.  This is the Internet, so I'm shouting out what's important to me.  :-)  A bit of history first.  I started in 1997 with <a href = "https://www.redhat.com/en" target="blank">Red Hat</a>, moved to <a href = "https://gentoo.org/" target="blank">Gentoo</a> to learn nuts and bolts, then ended up using <a href = "http://www.kubuntu.org/" target="blank">Kubuntu</a> because I liked things "that just worked".

So even with all my <a href = "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=distrohopper" target="blank">distro hopping</a>, my main systems are Kubuntu.  Well, on older systems that are still "production", I use <a href = "http://lubuntu.net/" target="blank">Lubuntu</a>.  But when are you finally getting to <a href = "https://manjaro.org/" target="blank">Manjaro</a>, the peanut gallery asks?  Well soon, soon.

Now!  Why do I like Manjaro?  The distro has the right mix of a lot of qualities.  Being <a href = "https://www.archlinux.org/" target="blank">Arch</a> based, they have the long list of packages from Arch (especially AUR).  They have ease of install/update of <a href = "https://antergos.com/" target="blank">Antergos</a>, another Arch-based distro.  They have a huge community around the distro.

But there are two other aspects that are perhaps first among equals.  One, they have stability in mind. They do additional testing before moving over the Arch packages and don't always put the bleeding edge.  The other is that though installation and management is easy, they do keep to the DIY or build-it-yourself nature of Arch.  You can approach Manjaro that was if you want to do so.  This aspect reminds me of Gentoo, so one can learn a lot going through installation and configuration of packages.

Can you do that with Debian or other distros?  Sure.  Though Manjaro is built from the ground up on giving control of most aspects of your OS to you.  Its easy to explore the installation and configuration of stable packages.  Thus less likely to have problems because of bugs, just your own mis-steps.  And if you want to develop or work on bleeding edge software?  No problem with Manjaro as well.

So that, in a nut shell, is why I like Manjaro.  Keeping along with many other parts of the Linux community, delivering many positives and tons of possibilities.  Besides, variety is the spice of life, and it keeps one on their toes.  :-)
