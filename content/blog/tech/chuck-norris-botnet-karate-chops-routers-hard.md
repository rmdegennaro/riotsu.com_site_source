Yeah, cheesy title for an article (<a href = "http://www.pcworld.com/article/189868/chuck_norris_botnet_karatechops_routers_hard.html" target="blank">original below</a>). But after recently having to help out too many clients and friends with virus issues, I wanted to get this article out there. Its an interesting real-life example of why you should change the password on your router, (and not leave passwords blank in general). Oh, for those who don't speak techie, the router is what usually connects you to the Internet (whether wired or wireless).

For those who just want a short synopsis... Just as your computer can get infected, so can routers. So ever wonder why security is important? Its for both your own protection (your computer and router) as well as others out on the web. This particular one infects your router, then looks to infect your own computer as well as attack others on the web. So, even though this targeted routers, the article says your computers (especially Windows users) could also be effected. Either keep your virus protection up-to-date and use a password/change the default password, or don't use Windows and make sure your security updates are installed.
