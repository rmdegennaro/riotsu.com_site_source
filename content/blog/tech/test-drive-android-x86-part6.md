Finishing up my chronicling of using an old laptop that is now running <a href = "http://www.android-x86.org/" target="blank">Android-x86</a>.  It was running Windows XP.  And I hate to throw away useful hardware, but also don't want to use an out-of-date insecure operating system.

Where we last left off was a bit of a hiccup in things.  Nothing major, but things were unstable when I had two Google accounts configured at the same time.  After I removed the extra account, things have been running smoothly for a while.

I decided though that this will be (one of) my distro-hopping machines.  So no more <a href = "http://www.android-x86.org/" target="blank">Android-x86</a>; more to come in the future...
