I haven't posted in a while.  And this one isn't really mine.  But, like many, for the first time in a long time, I look to the future with a promising smile.  Thanks to Jen, Jim and Ken for their wonderful words.

Barak Obama!
Freakylicious President!
Get your "Mo Jo" on!
                    A Haiku from Jen Jag


In bare feet by the thousands, chain-yanked off the auction block,
In pinched shoes moving on northward flight,
In just bought boots down the new hallways of Tuskegee,
In spikes churning up the Berlin dirt under the Fuhrer’s eye,
In laced-high shoes stepping through the ring to meet Schmeling
In ankle high russet browns trudging through the mud of Anzio
and stumbling over the crushed rock of Okinawa,
In flashing feet breaking for home plate and all of Brooklyn’s approving roar,
In the patent leather shoes of three little girls taking guarded steps to school,
In wild gliding, unstoppable, sliding motion on the floor of the Apollo,
In steel-toed GPs scrambling for cover at Tet and slogging the water-logged Mekong,
In stride, linked and determined, on the march, a preacher’s shined shoes at the fore,
from Selma to Montgomery, Albany, Birmingham, Chicago,
and up the steps to dream in Lincoln’s shadow,
that long shadow cast across the generations, across the throngs of Washington Mall
who have been on the move from every corner of the country
and pause now in wonder at where the weary feet have led.

-Jim


There once was a President named Barack
On Pennsylvania Ave. he's New Kid on the Block
He's promised transformation
For our wonderful Nation
So Come on America, let's Rock!

We have chosen Hope over Fear
For the next 4 (or 8) year
With #44 we ALL win
No matter the color of skin
So let's celebrate "change" with a beer!
