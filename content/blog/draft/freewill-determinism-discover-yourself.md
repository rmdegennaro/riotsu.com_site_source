It came up with in another great discussion with Becca about who a person really is inside.  Or more accurately in this particular conversation, what are the core qualities that make up a person.  The discussion started to go in the direction of similar thoughts I've had on the Freewill vs. Determinism debate.  Explaining this in a post should fun!

## Thoughts of the Past

Back in college, I used to think I liked philosophy.  I still do in many ways, but I wasn't very talented in explaining my ideas.  And that didn't make classes enjoyable all that often.  Anyways.  The idea I had back then (that seems relevant now) is that if one takes either idea to an extreme they both take on similar meanings and are not mutually exclusive.

Huh?  Yeah, I said "from a certain point of view" freewill and determinism are the same thing.  At least for our measly little human brains.  How?  In as few words as possible...  The only way we could know if its determinism is to know every possible piece of data.  Then see that only one possibility is actually going to happen next.  On the flip-side, to say its freewill is that to know every possible piece of data.  Then say the only way to determine what happens next is what the relevant folks choose.

Over-simplified?  Well, we often know what a friend is going to choose in many situations.  We even say "in retrospect, I knew Friend A was going to that".  That means in many ways we're boiling down emotion to a set of precepts.  Most often we give the idea of God to know what is in our minds.  From there my mind goes in two directions.  One is that freewill/determinism is a matter of perspective.  And the other is that the better thing to discuss is whether or not something that completely mimics a human is or is not truly human.

## Back To Self

So what does that have to do with discovering yourself?
