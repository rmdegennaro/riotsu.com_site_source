# Introduction:

This is just from some scribbled notes from something I've done on-the-fly.

# Ingredients:

  * 2 lbs. chicken breasts & thighs (boneless, skinless)
  * 4 onions (diced)
  * 4 tomatoes (diced)
  * 3 green chillies (diced)
  * 2 tbls ginger (freshly chopped/shaved)
  * 4 garlic cloves (crushed)
  * nutmeg
  * whole cloves
  * cardamom seeds
  * couple dashes coriander
  * couple dashes cumin
  * couple dashes tumeric

# Instructions:

Grind cloves & cardamom in mortal & pestle. Heat some oil and cook clove & cardamom for a tiny bit. Add onions & cook till browned; meaning after golden and before burnt! :-P
Add in the green chillies, ginger, garlic & cook for very short time. Add in rest of coriander, cumin & turmeric, making sure that nothing clumps.
Add in chicken & cook 5 minutes or so. Then add in nutmeg & tomatoes, cooking until chicken is done.

# Goes With:

Serve over basmati rice.
