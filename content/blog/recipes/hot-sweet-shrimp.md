# Introduction:

I copied this down from a package. I'm trying to tweak it to my pleasure with real spices/ingredients, not what is included in the pre-fab package.

# Ingredients:

  * 1 lbs. shrimp (shelled)
  * 2 onions (diced)
  * 4 tomatoes (diced)
  * 2 tbs tomato puree
  * 4 garlic cloves (crushed)
  * 3 green chillies (diced)
  * 2 tbs sugar (raw best)
  * couple dashes coriander
  * couple dashes cumin
  * couple dashes tumeric
  * couple dashes red chili powder
  * couple dashes amchoor (mango powder)
  * couple dashes garam masala

# Instructions:

Fry onions with oil until golden brown. Add in garlic & cook a few more minutes. Add in cumin, coriander, red chili and tumeric & cook for a bit longer. Then add sugar & garam masala & cook for a bit longer. Stir in tomatoes, tomato puree and amchoor, cooking for 5 minutes or so. Lower heat, add in shrimp & cook until shrimp is tender.

# Goes With:

Serve with Naan and/or rice.
