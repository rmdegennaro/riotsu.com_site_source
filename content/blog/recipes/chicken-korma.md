# Introduction:

This recipe started with me trying to figure out how something was made at a restaurant.  It's evolved over time where I've tweaked things as I felt necessary.

# Ingredients:

  * 2 lbs. chicken breasts & thighs (boneless, skinless)
  * 2 cups yogurt (I like firm greek yogurt)
  * 2 tbs butter
  * 1 green chillies (diced)
  * 4 garlic cloves (crushed)
  * whole peppercorns
  * whole cloves
  * whole cardamom seeds
  * cumin
  * tumeric
  * black pepper
  * saffron

# Instructions:

Cook cloves, peppercorns & cardamom seeds in oil. Once sizzling good, add in garlic & chillies. Cook for short time, stirring quickly & don't burn.
Add in chicken & turmeric, cook on medium heat for ~10 minutes (until chicken is 50% done).
As that's cooking, mix yogurt with safron, red chili powder, black pepper and cumin.
Turn heat back up to high and add in yogurt mixture. Make sure to stir and coat chicken well. Lower to medium heat & cook for another 10 minutes.
Once chicken is almost done, add in butter and cook until sauce is thick.
