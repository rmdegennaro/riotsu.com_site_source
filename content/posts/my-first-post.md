# My First Use of Hugo
So far, so good.  I've created a site, added some themes and created this first post.  Mostly, it was all good.  

But I do one few thought.  I don't think its a good idea to have all my sites source not in some type of SCM.  It might be a bad habit, but I tend to create repositories and then start adding files.  This was not good because [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) did not like that the directory was empty.  Simple way around it was rename the directory, create site, copy site to directory and then rename directories around so I'm happy.  :-)

I'll add more as I go, but right now, just checking in source files before I build and put the result on github.
