I love food. I like to eat, I like to cook. I'm part Italian and a cancer; what can I say? I also like to make up my own recipes, usually only reading cook books for ideas.

Recipes are very limited right now, as I have recipes, like so much else, scattered in books, files, websites, bookmarks, scraps of paper, etc.  With the new Google Sites there is not an automatic way to create a list of sub-pages.  So please go to the menu above to get to recipes until they add it or I manually create a list of links.

# Cooking Tips

Below are some "secrets" that I keep around to make cooking easier.  Mostly about spices....

### Curry Spice Mix
I've accumulated this mix of spices over time.  

  * Coriander
  * Tumeric
  * Chillies
  * Salt
  * Cumin
  * Fennel
  * Black Pepper
  * Garlic
  * Ginger
  * Fenugreek
  * Cinnamon
  * Cloves
  * Anise
  * Mustard Seed

### Dhingra Garam Masala
I got this basic space mixture from an old girlfriend's mom (Mrs. Dhingra was from India).  I've used it in many recipes and is definitely delicious.

  * Coriander
  * Cumin
  * White Pepper
  * Cinnamon
  * Black Cardamum
  * Black Pepper
  * Ilychi

### Ginger Root
This is another trick from my mom. Keep a piece of ginger root in the freezer. Use a potato peeler to shave off the needed amount. The brown covering won't hurt you.
