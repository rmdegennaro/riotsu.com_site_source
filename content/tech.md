Technology seems to be ever present these days.  I'm not sure I'm on the cutting edge of it all, but I do play around with technology.  It's my profession; it's a hobby.  

While I am posting random [Tech Blog Posts](../categories/tech) that are more commentary-like, I also keep a Google Site called <a href="https://sites.google.com/riotsu.com/adventuresintech/" target="blank">Adventures in Technology</a>.  It has pages for:

  * <a href = "https://sites.google.com/riotsu.com/adventuresintech/projects" target="blank">Projects</a> (stuff that I'm "actively" working on)
  * <a href = "https://sites.google.com/riotsu.com/adventuresintech/reference" target="blank">Reference</a> <a href = "https://sites.google.com/riotsu.com/adventuresintech/for-padawans" target="blank">Manual</a> (stuff I don't want to forget or want to share)

Why?  Simply, it's easier to change the Google Site then to alter this static website.  :-)  Don't get me wrong, this <a href = "https://gohugo.io/" target="blank">Go Hugo</a> generated static is great, but fits into my world differently.  

For now, you can find my <a href = "https://github.com/rmdegennaro/" target="blank">personal profile</a>, <a href = "https://github.com/rdegennaro/" target="blank">work profile</a>, and profile for the <a href = "https://github.com/sscps" target="blank">school</a> I work.  When projects become more serious, I may directly link them here as well.
