Technology seems to be ever present these days.  I'm not sure I'm on the cutting edge of it all, but I do play around with technology.  It's my profession; it's a hobby.  

I keep a Google Site called <a href="https://sites.google.com/riotsu.com/adventuresintech/" target="blank">Adventures in Technology</a>.  It has pages for active projects; well many have dust on them.  There are also sections that are "reference manual" in nature.  Basically anything that is not just a "one off" blog posting goes up there.....

There are also [Tech Blog Posts](../categories/tech) that are more commentary-like.
