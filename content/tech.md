Technology is a big part of my life.  It's my profession.  It's what I enjoy.  Most of the [Tech Blog Posts](../categories/tech) are what I do for fun.

Also, I keep a Google Site called <a href="https://sites.google.com/riotsu.com/adventuresintech/" target="blank">Adventures in Technology</a> for various projects.  These are all things beyond just a "one off" blog posting.
